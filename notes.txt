bugs:
-

features: (I want to first focus on being able to actually book the site)
- add a login feature
- after transaction has gone through, need to update the database so that the calendar is booked on those days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WQap8VFLA4&ab_channel=Pabbly
- make sure the passing varible works from calculate price into the stripe amount
- need to do some testing with paying
- need to ensure you cant book already booked days - add redudancy in the database so it cant happen
- need to think about edge cases with the database - what happens if someone accidentally books & wants refund, how does stripe handle that?

- once this functionality is implemented, ask mom about pricing & what else she wants on the site (photos, ect)
- make it prettier & more user friendly

-update to newer version of stripe?
- need to create a new account with stripe - mom's own account and don't leak API keys!!
