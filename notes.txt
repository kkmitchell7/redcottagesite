bugs:
-

features: (I want to first focus on being able to actually book the site)

- after transaction has gone through, need to update the database so that the calendar is booked on those days
- need to ensure you cant book already booked days - add redudancy in the database so it cant happen
- test to make sure you cant click on booked days
- need to think about edge cases with the database - what happens if someone accidentally books & wants refund, how does stripe handle that?

- once this functionality is implemented, ask mom about pricing & what else she wants on the site (photos, ect)
- make it prettier & more user friendly

-update to newer version of stripe?
